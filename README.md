#apertium-translator-java-api
* * *

Provides a Java wrapper around the Apertium machine translation web service API. 

Currently, only the service for translating a single string is implemented in this API. The translate service is not implemented for an array of strings, and the listPairs service is not implemented.

This project was forked from the microsoft-translator-java-api project by Jonathan Griggs.
