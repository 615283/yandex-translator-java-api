# microsoft-translator-java-api

Provides a Java wrapper around the Microsoft Translator API. 

Created in an attempt to fill the void left by the [deprecation](http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/05/spring-cleaning-for-some-of-our-apis.html) of the [Google Translate API](http://code.google.com/apis/language/translate/overview.html) announced on May 26, 2011 and scheduled for permanent shutdown on December 1, 2011.

In an effort to lessen the impact on Java developers that have previously integrated the Google Translate API into their applications, it
is my goal to mirror the code structure, naming conventions, functionality, and usage patterns of the excellent and widely used [google-api-translate-java](https://github.com/richmidwinter/google-api-translate-java) by Rich Midwinter.
